# 🏃 ARC Runner Set 2 – JDW Platform Custom Agents

This folder contains the configuration for **ARC Runner Set 2**, providing custom self-hosted GitHub Actions runners for the JDW Platform. It builds on the default settings but injects a JDW-specific agent image and environment.

# How many runner pods to scale between
maxRunners: 5
minRunners: 1

# Name of this runner scale set
runnerScaleSetName: "ubuntu-jdw-custom"

# Container mode: use Kubernetes pods for each job
containerMode:
  type: "kubernetes"
  kubernetesModeWorkVolumeClaim:
    accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Install or upgrade** Runner Set 2 via Helm or ArgoCD:
   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install arc-runner-set-2 oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set \
     -n arc-runners \
     -f arc-runner-set-2-values.yaml
   ```
2. **Confirm** runners appear in your GitHub organization under **Settings → Actions → Runners**.

## 🔒 Security

- Credentials are stored securely in the `jdwillmsen-github-app` Kubernetes secret.
- The custom agent image does not expose any sensitive data.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Monitoring

- List pods:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n arc-runners -l actions.github.com/scale-set-name=ubuntu-jdw-custom
  ```
- Tail logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -f <runner-pod> -n arc-runners
  ```
- Verify custom env vars inside a runner pod:
  ```bash
  kubectl exec -it <runner-pod> -n arc-runners -- env | grep JDW_
  ```
